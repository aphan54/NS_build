# Building a Triplex for Three Families on the North Shore, NSW, Sydney: Preparation Plan

You want to build a triplex for three families on Sydney’s North Shore, within 10 km of the Sydney CBD. Each property needs 300 m² of land (totaling 900 m²) and a 200 m² footprint home (600 m² total built area). This plan outlines the steps to prepare and understand the process, considering local regulations, zoning, and construction requirements. It assumes you own or will acquire a suitable block. Here’s how to proceed.

---

## Step 1: Define Your Goals and Budget
1. **Clarify Your Purpose**: You’re building for three families, likely for personal use, multi-generational living, or investment. Each unit will be spacious (200 m² footprint), suggesting a focus on comfort and long-term value.
2. **Set a Budget**: For a 900 m² block and three 200 m² homes:
   - **Land Cost**: Within 10 km of Sydney CBD, North Shore land prices (e.g., North Sydney, Crows Nest) range from $2,000-$3,500/m², so expect $1.8M-$3.15M for 900 m².
   - **Construction Cost**: At $2,500-$3,500/m² for quality builds, 600 m² total footprint = $1.5M-$2.1M.
   - **Additional Costs**: Design, approvals, utilities, landscaping, and 10-20% contingency add ~$300K-$500K.
   - **Total Estimate**: $3.6M-$5.75M.
3. **Research Market Demand**: Suburbs like North Sydney, Kirribilli, or Neutral Bay (within 10 km) have high demand for spacious family homes. Rental yields could be $1,000-$1,500/week per unit; sale values may exceed $1.5M each.

---

## Step 2: Assess Your Land and Zoning
1. **Land Requirement**: You need at least 900 m² (300 m² per family). Check your block’s size or target properties meeting this minimum.
2. **Suburbs Within 10 km**: North Shore options include North Sydney (4 km), Crows Nest (5 km), Neutral Bay (6 km), Mosman (7 km), or Kirribilli (3 km). Verify distances and land availability via real estate listings (e.g., Domain, Realestate.com.au).
3. **Zoning Check**: Contact the relevant council (e.g., North Sydney Council, Mosman Council):
   - **R20-R30 Zoning**: Common in these areas, allowing triplexes on 900 m²+ blocks.
   - Confirm setbacks, height limits (typically 8.5 m), and floor space ratio (FSR, often 0.5:1 to 0.7:1).
   - Ask if a Development Application (DA) or Complying Development Certificate (CDC) applies.
4. **Site Constraints**: Assess slope (e.g., Mosman’s hilly terrain), trees, soil, and access. A 900 m² block may need a shared driveway or separate entries.

## Step 3: Assemble Your Team
1. **Hire an Architect**: Find one experienced in triplexes for family living in North Shore suburbs. They’ll design three 200 m² homes on 300 m² lots within 900 m².
2. **Engage a Town Planner**: Essential for navigating tight zoning rules near the CBD and ensuring compliance with the Local Environmental Plan (LEP) and Development Control Plan (DCP).
3. **Consult a Builder**: Choose a multi-dwelling specialist (e.g., Metricon or Rawson Homes) for cost estimates and construction expertise.
4. **Other Experts**: Plan for a surveyor, structural engineer (for large footprints), and landscaper.

---

## Step 4: Conduct a Feasibility Study
1. **Site Assessment**: Evaluate:
   - Subdivision into three 300 m² lots (strata or Torrens title).
   - Access for three homes (e.g., shared driveway or individual frontages).
   - Environmental factors (e.g., flooding in low-lying Neutral Bay).
2. **Cost Analysis**: Combine land ($1.8M-$3.15M), construction ($1.5M-$2.1M), and extras ($300K-$500K). Compare to rental income ($150K-$230K/year) or sale value ($4.5M+ total).
3. **Timeframe**: Expect 12-24 months, including approvals (longer near CBD due to scrutiny) and 9-12 months for construction.

## Step 5: Design the Triplex
1. **Layout Options**:
   - **Side-by-Side**: Three 200 m² single-storey homes (needs a wide block, ~45 m frontage).
   - **Double-Storey**: Three 200 m² homes over two levels (100 m² per floor), fitting narrower blocks.
   - **Hybrid**: Mix of single and double-storey units.
2. **Family-Friendly Features**: Include 3-4 bedrooms, 2+ bathrooms, open-plan living, and parking (2 spaces per home, totaling 6). Add yards or balconies (100 m² land leftover per lot after 200 m² footprint).
3. **BASIX Compliance**: NSW requires a Building Sustainability Index (BASIX) certificate. Integrate solar panels, water tanks, and insulation.

---

## Step 6: Navigate Approvals
1. **Pre-DA Meeting**: Meet your council (e.g., North Sydney) to discuss a 900 m² triplex with three 200 m² homes.
2. **Submit a Development Application (DA)**:
   - Provide plans, site analysis, shadow diagrams, and a Statement of Environmental Effects (SEE).
   - Fees: $5,000-$10,000+ due to project scale.
   - Approval: 3-6 months, longer if heritage (e.g., Kirribilli) or neighbor objections arise.
3. **CDC Option**: If compliant with pre-set rules, a private certifier can approve faster. Confirm eligibility.
4. **Subdivision**: Plan for strata titles (three units on one lot) or Torrens titles (three separate 300 m² lots, costlier but more valuable).

---

## Step 7: Secure Financing
1. **Construction Loan**: Secure $3.6M-$5.75M from a bank, backed by detailed plans and costings.
2. **Equity**: Use owned land as collateral to lower borrowing.
3. **Grants**: Explore NSW sustainability incentives to offset costs.

---

## Step 8: Prepare for Construction
1. **Finalise Plans**: Obtain engineering drawings and a construction certificate (CC).
2. **Tender Builders**: Get quotes for three 200 m² homes; sign an HIA or MBA contract.
3. **Utilities**: Connect water, power, and sewer via Sydney Water. Secure permits for road works.
4. **Site Prep**: Clear the 900 m² block, fence it, and manage erosion.

---

## Step 9: Build and Monitor
1. **Construction**: 9-12 months for 600 m² total footprint. Visit regularly to ensure quality.
2. **Inspections**: Council checks at footings, framing, and completion.
3. **Subdivision**: Lodge titles with NSW Land Registry post-build if subdividing.

---

## Step 10: Completion and Next Steps
1. **Occupation Certificate (OC)**: Issued when homes meet standards.
2. **Fit-Out**: Add kitchens, bathrooms, and landscaping (e.g., 100 m² yards per lot).
3. **Outcome**: House three families, rent ($1,000-$1,500/week per unit), or sell ($1.5M+ per unit).

## Key Tips for North Shore (Within 10 km of CBD)
- **Council Nuances**: North Sydney prioritizes sustainability; Mosman emphasizes heritage. Check specific DCPs.
- **Space**: 200 m² homes are large—ensure designs maximize light and privacy on 300 m² lots.
- **Parking**: Plan 6 spaces (2 per family), critical near CBD where parking is scarce.
