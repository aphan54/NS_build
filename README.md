# Building a Triplex for Three Families on the North Shore, NSW, Sydney: Preparation Plan

This plan outlines the steps to prepare for building a triplex for three families on Sydney’s North Shore, where each property requires 300 m² of land (900 m² total) and a 200 m² footprint home (600 m² total built area). The location must be within a 7-minute drive to a station on the new Sydney Metro (e.g., Crows Nest or Chatswood stations on the City & Southwest line), excluding suburbs from Crows Nest towards the Sydney CBD and Chatswood itself. The plan includes St Leonards (North Sydney Council), Artarmon (Willoughby Council), Lane Cove (Lane Cove Council), and Lindfield, Roseville, and Roseville Chase (Ku-ring-gai Council), all 6-13 km from CBD, meeting the Metro proximity requirement. It assumes ownership or acquisition of a suitable block. Here’s how to proceed.

---

## Step 1: Define Goals and Budget
1. **Clarify Purpose**: Determine if the triplex is for personal use, multi-generational living, or investment. Each 200 m² home suggests a spacious, family-oriented design.
2. **Set a Budget**:
   - **Land Cost**: Range $1.39M-$4.82M, Average $1.99M for 900 m² (derived from sale price minus insurance rebuild cost). For 32 Ormonde Road (1,100 m², vacant): $1.95M + 10% greed premium = $2.145M.
   - **Construction Cost**: Range $1.5M-$2.1M, Average $1.8M for 600 m² total footprint (Rawlinsons 2025).
   - **Extras**: Range $300K-$500K, Average $400K (design, approvals, utilities, landscaping, contingency).
   - **Total Estimate**: Range $3.19M-$7.42M, Average $4.19M (900 m²); $4.345M for 32 Ormonde Road (1,100 m²).
3. **Research Market Demand**: These suburbs have strong demand near Metro stations. Rentals could yield $1,000-$1,300/week per unit (average $1,150/week); sale values may exceed $1.3M-$1.5M per unit (average $1.4M).

## Step 2: Assess Land and Zoning
1. **Land Requirement**: Secure at least 900 m² (300 m² per family).
2. **Eligible Suburbs**: Choose locations within 7 minutes’ drive to Metro stations, 6-13 km from CBD:
   - **St Leonards**: ~5-6 min to Crows Nest Metro (6 km from CBD, North Sydney Council).
   - **Artarmon**: ~5-6 min to Crows Nest Metro (7 km from CBD, Willoughby Council).
   - **Lane Cove**: ~6-7 min to Crows Nest Metro (8 km from CBD, Lane Cove Council).
   - **Lindfield**: ~6-7 min to Chatswood Metro (13 km from CBD, Ku-ring-gai Council).
   - **Roseville**: ~6-7 min to Chatswood Metro (12 km from CBD, Ku-ring-gai Council).
   - **Roseville Chase**: ~6-7 min to Chatswood Metro (12 km from CBD, Ku-ring-gai Council).
   (Drive times assume light traffic; verify with Google Maps.)
3. **Zoning Check**: Confirm zoning with each council’s Local Environmental Plan (LEP). Below are detailed zoning requirements for triplex development:

### North Sydney Council (St Leonards)
- **Relevant LEP**: North Sydney Local Environmental Plan 2013 (amended to 2025).
- **Applicable Zones**: R3 Medium Density Residential (common in St Leonards near Metro).
- **Minimum Lot Size**: 600 m² for multi-dwelling housing (Clause 4.1); 900 m² exceeds this.
- **Height Limit**: 12 m (Clause 4.3, varies by map; check Height of Buildings Map).
- **Floor Space Ratio (FSR)**: 0.9:1 (Clause 4.4, check FSR Map). For 900 m²: 810 m² max GFA; 600 m² fits.
- **Triplex Permissibility**: “Multi-dwelling housing” permitted in R3 zones. Strata or Torrens subdivision possible (Clause 4.1A).
- **Specific Considerations**: High-density overlays near Metro; ensure setbacks (6 m front, 3 m side/rear) and parking (6 spaces) per North Sydney DCP 2013. Check heritage/flood zones.

### Willoughby Council (Artarmon)
- **Relevant LEP**: Willoughby Local Environmental Plan 2012 (amended to 2025).
- **Applicable Zones**: R2 Low Density Residential or R3 Medium Density Residential.
- **Minimum Lot Size**: R2: 450 m² (NSW dual occupancy reform, 2025); R3: 700 m² for multi-dwelling housing (Clause 4.1). 900 m² exceeds both.
- **Height Limit**: R2: 9.5 m; R3: 12 m (Clause 4.3, check Height of Buildings Map).
- **Floor Space Ratio (FSR)**: R2: 0.5:1 (450 m² GFA); R3: 0.7:1 (630 m² GFA) (Clause 4.4, check FSR Map). 600 m² fits R3, exceeds R2.
- **Triplex Permissibility**: R2 allows dual occupancy; R3 permits “multi-dwelling housing.” Target R3 zones; Strata/Torrens viable.
- **Specific Considerations**: Willoughby DCP 2022 requires 6 m front setback, 1.5-3 m side/rear, 50% landscaping, 6 parking spaces. Check bushfire/heritage.

### Lane Cove Council (Lane Cove)
- **Relevant LEP**: Lane Cove Local Environmental Plan 2009 (amended to 2025).
- **Applicable Zones**: R3 Medium Density Residential.
- **Minimum Lot Size**: 800 m² for multi-dwelling housing (Clause 4.1); 900 m² meets this.
- **Height Limit**: 9.5 m (Clause 4.3, up to 12 m near hubs; check Height of Buildings Map).
- **Floor Space Ratio (FSR)**: 0.6:1 (Clause 4.4, check FSR Map). For 900 m²: 540 m² max GFA; 600 m² exceeds, needs variation.
- **Triplex Permissibility**: “Multi-dwelling housing” permitted in R3; Strata/Torrens allowed (Clause 4.1A). R2 limits to dual occupancy.
- **Specific Considerations**: Lane Cove DCP 2010 mandates 6 m front setback, 3 m side/rear, 40% landscaping, 6 parking spaces. Check slopes/heritage.

### Ku-ring-gai Council (Lindfield, Roseville, Roseville Chase)
- **Relevant LEP**: Ku-ring-gai Local Environmental Plan 2015 (amended to 2025).
- **Applicable Zones**: R2 Low Density Residential or R3 Medium Density Residential.
- **Minimum Lot Size**: R2: 700 m² proposed for dual occupancy (2025 consultation, Option A); R3: 900 m² for multi-dwelling housing (Clause 4.1). 900 m² meets R3, exceeds R2.
- **Height Limit**: R2: 9.5 m; R3: 12 m (Clause 4.3, check Height of Buildings Map; varies near stations).
- **Floor Space Ratio (FSR)**: R2: 0.3:1 (270 m² GFA); R3: 0.6:1 (540 m² GFA) (Clause 4.4, check FSR Map). 600 m² exceeds both; R3 variation feasible.
- **Triplex Permissibility**: R2 permits dual occupancy; R3 allows “multi-dwelling housing.” Focus on R3 zones; Strata/Torrens possible.
- **Specific Considerations**: Ku-ring-gai DCP 2016 requires 50% canopy cover, 8 m front setback, 3 m side/rear, 6 parking spaces. Check heritage (e.g., Roseville HCA).

4. **Site Constraints**: Investigate these factors for each potential site:
   - **Topography and Slope**: Assess gradient for foundation, excavation, drainage. Slopes >15% need retaining walls/stepped designs.
   - **Soil Type and Stability**: Test clay, rock, or sandy soils. Clay may require deeper footings; rock increases costs.
   - **Tree Preservation**: Identify protected trees (e.g., Ku-ring-gai’s 50% canopy). Removal needs approval/offsets.
   - **Flood Risk**: Check flood maps (e.g., St Leonards stormwater, Lane Cove lowlands). Flood-prone sites need mitigation.
   - **Bushfire Risk**: Evaluate BAL ratings (e.g., Ku-ring-gai’s leafy areas). BAL-29+ requires fire-resistant materials.
   - **Heritage Constraints**: Confirm listings/conservation areas (e.g., Roseville HCA). Limits demolition/design.
   - **Access and Driveways**: Ensure 15 m width for shared driveway, street access for 6 parking spaces.
   - **Utility Connections**: Verify sewer, water, power proximity (Sydney Water, Ausgrid). Easements may restrict layout.
   - **Shadow Impacts**: Model solar access for neighbors (2-3 hours midwinter per DCP). Taller designs may trigger objections.
   - **Noise and Traffic**: Assess proximity to highways (e.g., Pacific Hwy) or rail lines. Acoustic buffering may be needed.
   - **Contamination**: Check past industrial use (e.g., Artarmon). Soil testing for pollutants required.
   - **Overland Flow Paths**: Map stormwater runoff (e.g., Lane Cove, Ku-ring-gai). Avoid floodways; design drainage.
   - **Privacy Impacts**: Ensure setbacks/windows minimize overlooking (3 m side/rear per DCPs).
   - **Easements and Covenants**: Check title for restrictions (e.g., drainage easements). Limits buildable area.
   - **Site Orientation**: Optimize north-facing for solar gain (BASIX). Poor orientation increases energy costs.
   - **Geotechnical Hazards**: Investigate landslides/subsidence (e.g., Ku-ring-gai slopes). Geotech reports may be mandatory.
   - **Vegetation and Biodiversity**: Identify native species/habitat (e.g., Ku-ring-gai koala corridors). Clearing needs assessment.

## Step 3: Evaluate a Possible Property
Evaluate the property at **32 Ormonde Road, Roseville Chase, NSW 2069**, a 4,500 m² parcel recently subdivided into four lots, with one vacant 1,100 m² lot targeted for purchase (no existing house). Assess against Steps 1 and 2 criteria, with additional analysis:

### Step 1 Criteria Evaluation
1. **Purpose**: The 1,100 m² lot exceeds the 900 m² minimum, supporting a triplex for personal use, multi-generational living, or investment. Each 200 m² home fits family-oriented design (3-4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 2 parking spaces).
2. **Budget**:
   - **Land Cost**: Base $1.95M (updated avg $1,773/m² × 1,100 m²) + 10% greed premium = $2.145M. Below $4.82M high, above $1.99M avg for 900 m², reflecting seller premium for waterfront proximity.
   - **Construction Cost**: $1.5M-$2.1M (avg $1.8M) for 600 m² triplex.
   - **Extras**: $300K-$500K (avg $400K).
   - **Total Estimate**: $2.145M (land) + $1.8M (construction) + $400K (extras) = $4.345M. Below avg $4.19M (900 m²), within $3.19M-$7.42M range.
3. **Market Demand**: Rentals at $1,000-$1,200/week (avg $1,125/week) yield $175.5K/year (within $130K-$200K, avg $179.4K). Sale value at $1.35M-$1.5M/unit (avg $1.425M) totals $4.275M (within $3.9M-$4.5M, avg $4.2M).

### Step 2 Criteria Evaluation
1. **Land Requirement**: 1,100 m² exceeds 900 m², offering flexibility for yards, parking, or landscaping.
2. **Location**: ~6-7 min drive to Chatswood Metro (12 km from CBD), meeting the criterion (Google Maps, light traffic).
3. **Zoning (Ku-ring-gai Council)**:
   - **Zone**: Likely R3 Medium Density Residential (near Chatswood Metro). Confirm via Ku-ring-gai LEP 2015 zoning map.
   - **Minimum Lot Size**: 900 m² for R3; 1,100 m² complies.
   - **Height Limit**: 12 m in R3 (double-storey triplex feasible, ~10 m height).
   - **FSR**: 0.6:1; 1,100 m² × 0.6 = 660 m² max GFA. 600 m² fits, no variation needed.
   - **Permissibility**: “Multi-dwelling housing” permitted in R3; Strata/Torrens viable.
   - **Considerations**: Ku-ring-gai DCP 2016 requires 8 m front setback, 3 m side/rear, 50% canopy cover, 6 parking spaces—all achievable on 1,100 m².
4. **Site Constraints**:
   - **Topography/Slope**: Waterfront reserve backdrop suggests a slope to Middle Harbour. Likely >15% gradient; retaining walls or stepped design needed, adding ~$50K-$100K to extras.
   - **Soil Type/Stability**: Clay/sandstone mix typical; waterfront may soften soils, requiring deeper footings (~$20K-$40K extra).
   - **Tree Preservation**: 50% canopy cover required; bushland proximity means protected trees. Removal offsets may cost $10K-$20K.
   - **Flood Risk**: Near Middle Harbour; flood maps needed. Mitigation (e.g., raised foundations) could add $30K-$50K.
   - **Bushfire Risk**: Leafy area; BAL-29+ likely, adding $20K-$30K for fire-resistant materials.
   - **Access/Driveways**: Circular driveway exists; post-subdivision frontage must support 15 m shared driveway (6 spaces feasible).
   - **Utility Connections**: Existing services nearby (sewer, water, power); confirm capacity ($20K-$40K connection cost).
   - **Other Constraints**: No heritage listing; check easements (waterfront risk); north-facing orientation possible.

### Additional Analysis
#### Construction Cost Comparison (Per Property)
- **Proposed Specs**: 200 m², 3-4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, double brick, tiled roof, 2-car garage, modern finishes.
- **Cost**: $1.8M / 3 = $600K per 200 m² home ($3,000/m² avg).
- **Comparables**:
  - **5 Ormonde Rd, Roseville Chase**: Sold $3.052M (930 m² lot, 200 m² house), Nov 2022 (Domain). Rebuild 200 m² double brick, 4 bed, 2 bath, 3-car garage = $600K (Rawlinsons 2025). Land $2.452M. Build cost aligns at $3,000/m².
  - **28 Ormonde Rd, Roseville Chase**: Sold $2.625M (950 m² lot, 210 m² house), Oct 2024 (PropertyValue). Rebuild 210 m², 4 bed, 2 bath, double brick = $630K. Land $1.995M. $3,000/m² matches.
  - **9 Bancroft Ave, Roseville**: Sold $2.205M (900 m² lot, 170 m² house), Nov 2024 (Domain). Rebuild 170 m², 3 bed, 2 bath, brick = $510K. Land $1.695M. $3,000/m² consistent.
  - **12 Austin St, Lane Cove**: 200 m² home, $550K build cost, Nov 2024 (builder quote). 3 bed, 2 bath, brick veneer. $2,750/m², slightly below due to simpler specs.
- **Analysis**: $600K per property aligns with local rebuild costs ($2,750-$3,000/m²) for similar specs. Double brick and modern finishes justify the $3,000/m² avg vs. $2,750/m² for brick veneer.

#### Sale Value and ROI Estimate
- **Sale Value**: 
  - Local triplex units (200 m², 3-4 bed, 2 bath): $1.35M-$1.5M (avg $1.425M).
  - 32 Ormonde Road (waterfront proximity, new build premium): $1.4M-$1.55M/unit (avg $1.475M).
  - Total Sale Value: $1.475M × 3 = $4.425M (range $4.2M-$4.65M).
- **Total Cost**: $4.345M (land $2.145M + construction $1.8M + extras $400K).
- **Profit**: $4.425M - $4.345M = $80K (range -$145K to $305K).
- **ROI**: ($80K / $4.345M) × 100 = 1.84% (range -3.34% to 7.02%). With high-end sale ($4.65M), ROI = 7.02%.
- **Adjusted for 10% ROI Target**: Sale value needed = $4.345M × 1.10 = $4.7795M ($1.593M/unit), achievable with premium finishes or market uptick.

### Conclusion
32 Ormonde Road’s 1,100 m² vacant lot is highly viable for a triplex, meeting zoning (R3) and location requirements. At $4.345M total (including $2.145M land with 10% greed premium), it’s below the $4.19M avg, offering value. Construction costs ($600K/unit) align with local comparables (200 m², 3-4 bed, 2 bath, double brick at $3,000/m²). Sale value ($4.425M) yields a modest 1.84% ROI, but a $4.78M sale (10% ROI) is feasible with premium design or market growth. Site constraints (slope, flood, bushfire) add $150K-$250K to extras, potentially offset by 1,100 m² flexibility. Confirm zoning, subdivision status, and constraints with Ku-ring-gai Council.
