# Building a Triplex for Three Families on the North Shore, NSW, Sydney: Preparation Plan

This plan outlines the steps to prepare for building a triplex for three families on Sydney’s North Shore, where each property requires 300 m² of land (900 m² total) and a 200 m² footprint home (600 m² total built area). The location must be within a 7-minute drive to a station on the new Sydney Metro (e.g., Crows Nest or Chatswood stations on the City & Southwest line), excluding suburbs from Crows Nest towards the Sydney CBD and Chatswood itself. The plan includes St Leonards, Artarmon, Lane Cove, Lindfield, and Roseville (6-13 km from CBD), all meeting the Metro proximity requirement. It assumes ownership or acquisition of a suitable block. Here’s how to proceed.

---

## Step 1: Define Goals and Budget
1. **Clarify Purpose**: Determine if the triplex is for personal use, multi-generational living, or investment. Each 200 m² home suggests a spacious, family-oriented design.
2. **Set a Budget**:
   - **Land Cost**: Range $1.62M-$2.52M, Average $2.04M for 900 m².
   - **Construction Cost**: Range $1.5M-$2.1M, Average $1.8M for 600 m² total footprint.
   - **Extras**: Range $300K-$500K, Average $400K (design, approvals, utilities, landscaping, contingency).
   - **Total Estimate**: Range $3.42M-$5.12M, Average $4.24M.
3. **Research Market Demand**: These suburbs have strong demand near Metro stations. Rentals could yield $1,000-$1,300/week per unit (average $1,150/week); sale values may exceed $1.3M-$1.5M per unit (average $1.4M).

---

## Step 2: Assess Land and Zoning
1. **Land Requirement**: Secure at least 900 m² (300 m² per family).
2. **Eligible Suburbs**: Choose locations within 7 minutes’ drive to Metro stations, 6-13 km from CBD:
   - **St Leonards**: ~5-6 min to Crows Nest Metro (6 km from CBD, North Sydney Council).
   - **Artarmon**: ~5-6 min to Crows Nest Metro (7 km from CBD, Willoughby Council).
   - **Lane Cove**: ~6-7 min to Crows Nest Metro (8 km from CBD, Lane Cove Council).
   - **Lindfield**: ~6-7 min to Chatswood Metro (13 km from CBD, Ku-ring-gai Council).
   - **Roseville**: ~6-7 min to Chatswood Metro (12 km from CBD, Ku-ring-gai Council).
   (Drive times assume light traffic; verify with Google Maps.)
3. **Zoning Check**: Confirm zoning with each council’s Local Environmental Plan (LEP). Below are detailed zoning requirements for triplex development:

### North Sydney Council (St Leonards)
- **Relevant LEP**: North Sydney Local Environmental Plan 2013 (amended to 2025).
- **Applicable Zones**: R3 Medium Density Residential (common in St Leonards near Metro).
- **Minimum Lot Size**: 600 m² for multi-dwelling housing (Clause 4.1); 900 m² exceeds this.
- **Height Limit**: 12 m (Clause 4.3, varies by map; check Height of Buildings Map for specific St Leonards sites).
- **Floor Space Ratio (FSR)**: 0.9:1 (Clause 4.4, check FSR Map). For 900 m²: 810 m² max GFA; 600 m² fits within this.
- **Triplex Permissibility**: “Multi-dwelling housing” (three or more dwellings on one lot) is permitted in R3 zones. Strata or Torrens subdivision possible post-construction (Clause 4.1A allows flexibility for 900 m²+ lots).
- **Specific Considerations**: St Leonards has high-density overlays near the Metro; ensure setbacks (min 6 m front, 3 m side/rear per DCP) and parking (2 spaces/dwelling, 6 total) comply with North Sydney DCP 2013. Heritage or flood zones may restrict some sites.

### Willoughby Council (Artarmon)
- **Relevant LEP**: Willoughby Local Environmental Plan 2012 (amended to 2025).
- **Applicable Zones**: R2 Low Density Residential or R3 Medium Density Residential (Artarmon varies by precinct).
- **Minimum Lot Size**: R2: 450 m² (NSW dual occupancy reform, 2025); R3: 700 m² for multi-dwelling housing (Clause 4.1). 900 m² exceeds both.
- **Height Limit**: R2: 9.5 m; R3: 12 m (Clause 4.3, check Height of Buildings Map).
- **Floor Space Ratio (FSR)**: R2: 0.5:1 (450 m² GFA); R3: 0.7:1 (630 m² GFA) (Clause 4.4, check FSR Map). 600 m² fits R3 but exceeds R2.
- **Triplex Permissibility**: R2 allows dual occupancy (two dwellings); R3 permits “multi-dwelling housing” (three+ dwellings). Target R3 zones for a triplex, or seek a DA variation in R2 (less likely to succeed). Strata/Torrens viable in R3.
- **Specific Considerations**: Willoughby DCP 2022 requires 6 m front setback, 1.5-3 m side/rear, and 50% site landscaping. Parking: 2 spaces/dwelling (6 total). Check bushfire or heritage constraints.

### Lane Cove Council (Lane Cove)
- **Relevant LEP**: Lane Cove Local Environmental Plan 2009 (amended to 2025).
- **Applicable Zones**: R3 Medium Density Residential (prevalent near Metro proximity areas).
- **Minimum Lot Size**: 800 m² for multi-dwelling housing (Clause 4.1); 900 m² meets this.
- **Height Limit**: 9.5 m (Clause 4.3, check Height of Buildings Map; some areas up to 12 m near transport hubs).
- **Floor Space Ratio (FSR)**: 0.6:1 (Clause 4.4, check FSR Map). For 900 m²: 540 m² max GFA; 600 m² exceeds this, requiring a variation or smaller design.
- **Triplex Permissibility**: “Multi-dwelling housing” permitted in R3 zones. Strata or Torrens subdivision allowed (Clause 4.1A). R2 zones (450 m² min) limit to dual occupancy.
- **Specific Considerations**: Lane Cove DCP 2010 mandates 6 m front setback, 3 m side/rear, and 40% landscaped area. Parking: 2 spaces/dwelling (6 total). Steep slopes or heritage items may impact site selection.

### Ku-ring-gai Council (Lindfield, Roseville)
- **Relevant LEP**: Ku-ring-gai Local Environmental Plan 2015 (amended to 2025).
- **Applicable Zones**: R2 Low Density Residential (common) or R3 Medium Density Residential (near stations).
- **Minimum Lot Size**: R2: 700 m² proposed for dual occupancy (2025 consultation, Option A); R3: 900 m² for multi-dwelling housing (Clause 4.1). 900 m² meets R3, exceeds R2.
- **Height Limit**: R2: 9.5 m; R3: 12 m (Clause 4.3, check Height of Buildings Map; varies near stations).
- **Floor Space Ratio (FSR)**: R2: 0.3:1 (270 m² GFA); R3: 0.6:1 (540 m² GFA) (Clause 4.4, check FSR Map). 600 m² exceeds both; R3 variation more feasible.
- **Triplex Permissibility**: R2 permits dual occupancy (two dwellings); R3 allows “multi-dwelling housing” (three+ dwellings). Focus on R3 zones near Lindfield/Roseville stations. Strata/Torrens possible in R3.
- **Specific Considerations**: Ku-ring-gai DCP 2016 emphasizes tree preservation (50% canopy cover), 8 m front setback, 3 m side/rear, and 6 parking spaces. Heritage conservation areas (e.g., Roseville) may restrict development.

4. **Site Constraints**: Investigate the following factors for each potential site to ensure feasibility and compliance:
   - **Topography and Slope**: Assess gradient (e.g., Lane Cove’s steep terrain, Ku-ring-gai’s undulating land) for foundation design, excavation costs, and drainage. Slopes >15% may require retaining walls or stepped designs.
   - **Soil Type and Stability**: Test for clay, rock, or sandy soils (common in North Shore). Clay may shrink/swell, requiring deeper footings; rock increases excavation costs.
   - **Tree Preservation**: Identify protected trees (e.g., Ku-ring-gai’s 50% canopy rule, Willoughby’s 50% landscaping). Removal requires council approval and offsets.
   - **Flood Risk**: Check flood maps (e.g., St Leonards near stormwater channels, Lane Cove lowlands). Flood-prone sites need raised floors or mitigation.
   - **Bushfire Risk**: Evaluate BAL ratings (e.g., Artarmon bush interfaces, Ku-ring-gai’s leafy areas). BAL-29 or higher may require fire-resistant materials.
   - **Heritage Constraints**: Confirm heritage listings or conservation areas (e.g., Roseville HCA, St Leonards items). Heritage impacts may limit demolition or design.
   - **Access and Driveways**: Ensure site width (min 15 m for shared driveway) and street access support 6 parking spaces. Narrow frontages may complicate entry.
   - **Utility Connections**: Verify proximity to sewer, water, and power (Sydney Water, Ausgrid). Distant connections increase costs; easements may restrict layout.
   - **Shadow Impacts**: Model solar access for neighbors (DCP rules: 2-3 hours sunlight midwinter). Taller designs (e.g., 12 m in R3) may trigger objections.
   - **Noise and Traffic**: Assess proximity to Pacific Hwy (St Leonards, Artarmon) or rail lines (Lindfield, Roseville). Acoustic buffering may be needed.
   - **Contamination**: Investigate past industrial use (e.g., Artarmon’s historical factories). Soil testing for pollutants (e.g., heavy metals) may be required.
   - **Overland Flow Paths**: Map stormwater runoff (common in Lane Cove, Ku-ring-gai). Avoid floodways; design drainage solutions.
   - **Privacy Impacts**: Ensure setbacks and window placement minimize overlooking (e.g., 3 m side/rear per DCPs). Neighbor complaints can delay DA approval.
   - **Easements and Covenants**: Check title for restrictions (e.g., drainage easements, building envelopes). These may limit buildable area.
   - **Site Orientation**: Optimize north-facing aspects for solar gain (BASIX compliance). Poor orientation increases energy costs.
   - **Geotechnical Hazards**: Investigate landslides or subsidence risks (e.g., Ku-ring-gai’s slopes). Geotech reports may be mandatory.
   - **Vegetation and Biodiversity**: Identify native species or habitat (e.g., Ku-ring-gai’s koala corridors). Clearing may need ecological assessment.

3. **Timeframe**: Plan for 12-24 months (approvals 3-6 months, construction 9-12 months).

---

## Step 5: Design the Triplex
1. **Layout Options**: Consider side-by-side, double-storey, or hybrid designs.
2. **Family-Friendly Features**: Include 3-4 bedrooms, 2+ bathrooms, 2 parking spaces per home (6 total), and 100 m² yards.
3. **BASIX Compliance**: Incorporate solar panels, water tanks, and insulation.

---

## Step 6: Navigate Approvals
1. **Pre-DA Meeting**: Schedule a discussion with the council.
2. **Submit a DA**: Provide plans, site analysis, and fees ($5K-$10K+); expect 3-6 months for approval.
3. **CDC Option**: Pursue a faster route if compliant with council standards.
4. **Subdivision**: Decide on strata or Torrens titles.

---

## Step 7: Secure Financing
1. **Construction Loan**: Obtain $3.42M-$5.12M (avg $4.24M).
2. **Equity**: Leverage owned land if available.
3. **Grants**: Investigate NSW incentives.

---

## Step 8: Prepare for Construction
1. **Finalise Plans**: Complete engineering drawings and obtain a construction certificate.
2. **Tender Builders**: Request quotes for three 200 m² homes.
3. **Utilities**: Arrange Sydney Water connections and road permits.
4. **Site Prep**: Clear, fence, and manage erosion on the 900 m² block.

---

## Step 9: Build and Monitor
1. **Construction**: Allocate 9-12 months for 600 m².
2. **Inspections**: Schedule council checks at footings, framing, and completion.
3. **Subdivision**: Lodge titles if subdividing.

---

## Step 10: Complete and Decide Next Steps
1. **Occupation Certificate**: Secure once compliant.
2. **Fit-Out**: Install kitchens, bathrooms, and landscape yards.
3. **Outcome**: House families, rent units ($1,000-$1,300/week, avg $1,150/week), or sell ($1.3M-$1.5M per unit, avg $1.4M).
