# Building a Triplex for Three Families on the North Shore, NSW, Sydney: Preparation Plan

You want to build a triplex for three families on Sydney’s North Shore, with each property requiring 300 m² of land (900 m² total) and a 200 m² footprint home (600 m² total built area). The location must be within a 7-minute drive to a station on the new Sydney Metro (e.g., Crows Nest or Chatswood stations on the City & Southwest line), excluding suburbs from Crows Nest towards the Sydney CBD and Chatswood. This plan includes St Leonards, Artarmon, Lane Cove, Lindfield, and Roseville (6-13 km from CBD), all meeting the Metro proximity requirement. It assumes you own or will acquire a suitable block. Here’s how to proceed.

---

## Step 1: Define Your Goals and Budget
1. **Clarify Your Purpose**: You’re building for three families, likely for personal use, multi-generational living, or investment. Each 200 m² home suggests spacious, family-oriented design.
2. **Set a Budget**:
   - **Land Cost**: Range $1.62M-$2.52M, Average $2.04M for 900 m².
   - **Construction Cost**: Range $1.5M-$2.1M, Average $1.8M for 600 m² total footprint.
   - **Extras**: Range $300K-$500K, Average $400K (design, approvals, utilities, landscaping, contingency).
   - **Total Estimate**: Range $3.42M-$5.12M, Average $4.24M.
3. **Research Market Demand**: These suburbs have strong demand near Metro stations. Rentals could yield $1,000-$1,300/week per unit (average $1,150/week); sale values may exceed $1.3M-$1.5M per unit (average $1.4M).

---

## Step 2: Assess Your Land and Zoning
1. **Land Requirement**: You need at least 900 m² (300 m² per family).
2. **Eligible Suburbs**: Within 7 minutes’ drive to Metro stations, 6-13 km from CBD:
   - **St Leonards**: ~5-6 min to Crows Nest Metro (6 km from CBD).
   - **Artarmon**: ~5-6 min to Crows Nest Metro (7 km from CBD).
   - **Lane Cove**: ~6-7 min to Crows Nest Metro (8 km from CBD).
   - **Lindfield**: ~6-7 min to Chatswood Metro (13 km from CBD).
   - **Roseville**: ~6-7 min to Chatswood Metro (12 km from CBD).
   (Drive times assume light traffic; verify with Google Maps.)
3. **Zoning Check**: Contact councils (North Sydney, Willoughby, Lane Cove, Ku-ring-gai):
   - **R20-R30 Zoning**: Allows triplexes on 900 m²+.
   - Confirm setbacks, height limits (usually 8.5 m), and FSR (0.5:1-0.7:1).
4. **Site Constraints**: Assess slope, trees, soil, and access.

---

## Step 3: Assemble Your Team
1. **Hire an Architect**: For triplexes near Metro stations.
2. **Engage a Town Planner**: For zoning compliance.
3. **Consult a Builder**: Multi-dwelling expert (e.g., Clarendon Homes).
4. **Other Experts**: Surveyor, structural engineer, landscaper.

---

## Step 4: Conduct a Feasibility Study
1. **Site Assessment**: Subdivision, access, environmental factors.
2. **Cost Analysis**: Land ($1.62M-$2.52M, avg $2.04M), construction ($1.5M-$2.1M, avg $1.8M), extras ($300K-$500K, avg $400K). Compare to rental income ($130K-$200K/year, avg $179.4K) or sale value ($3.9M-$4.5M, avg $4.2M).
3. **Timeframe**: 12-24 months (approvals 3-6 months, construction 9-12 months).

---

## Step 5: Design the Triplex
1. **Layout Options**: Side-by-side, double-storey, or hybrid.
2. **Family-Friendly Features**: 3-4 bedrooms, 2+ bathrooms, 2 parking spaces per home (6 total), 100 m² yards.
3. **BASIX Compliance**: Solar panels, water tanks, insulation.

---

## Step 6: Navigate Approvals
1. **Pre-DA Meeting**: Discuss with council.
2. **Submit a DA**: Plans, site analysis, fees ($5K-$10K+), 3-6 months approval.
3. **CDC Option**: Faster if compliant.
4. **Subdivision**: Strata or Torrens titles.

---

## Step 7: Secure Financing
1. **Construction Loan**: $3.42M-$5.12M (avg $4.24M).
2. **Equity**: Use owned land.
3. **Grants**: Check NSW incentives.

---

## Step 8: Prepare for Construction
1. **Finalise Plans**: Engineering drawings, construction certificate.
2. **Tender Builders**: Quotes for three 200 m² homes.
3. **Utilities**: Sydney Water connections, road permits.
4. **Site Prep**: Clear, fence, manage erosion.

---

## Step 9: Build and Monitor
1. **Construction**: 9-12 months for 600 m².
2. **Inspections**: Footings, framing, completion.
3. **Subdivision**: Lodge titles if applicable.

---

## Step 10: Completion and Next Steps
1. **Occupation Certificate**: Issued when compliant.
2. **Fit-Out**: Kitchens, bathrooms, landscaping.
3. **Outcome**: House families, rent ($1,000-$1,300/week per unit, avg $1,150/week), or sell ($1.3M-$1.5M per unit, avg $1.4M).
