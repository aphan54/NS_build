# Building a Triplex for Three Families on the North Shore, NSW, Sydney: Preparation Plan

This plan outlines the steps to prepare for building a triplex for three families on Sydney’s North Shore, where each property requires 300 m² of land (900 m² total) and a 200 m² footprint home (600 m² total built area). The location must be within a 7-minute drive to a station on the new Sydney Metro (e.g., Crows Nest or Chatswood stations on the City & Southwest line), excluding suburbs from Crows Nest towards the Sydney CBD and Chatswood. The plan includes St Leonards, Artarmon, Lane Cove, Lindfield, and Roseville (6-13 km from CBD), all meeting the Metro proximity requirement. It assumes ownership or acquisition of a suitable block. Here’s how to proceed.

---

## Step 1: Define Goals and Budget
1. **Clarify Purpose**: Determine if the triplex is for personal use, multi-generational living, or investment. Each 200 m² home suggests a spacious, family-oriented design.
2. **Set a Budget**:
   - **Land Cost**: Range $1.62M-$2.52M, Average $2.04M for 900 m².
   - **Construction Cost**: Range $1.5M-$2.1M, Average $1.8M for 600 m² total footprint.
   - **Extras**: Range $300K-$500K, Average $400K (design, approvals, utilities, landscaping, contingency).
   - **Total Estimate**: Range $3.42M-$5.12M, Average $4.24M.
3. **Research Market Demand**: These suburbs have strong demand near Metro stations. Rentals could yield $1,000-$1,300/week per unit (average $1,150/week); sale values may exceed $1.3M-$1.5M per unit (average $1.4M).

---

## Step 2: Assess Land and Zoning
1. **Land Requirement**: Secure at least 900 m² (300 m² per family).
2. **Eligible Suburbs**: Choose locations within 7 minutes’ drive to Metro stations, 6-13 km from CBD:
   - **St Leonards**: ~5-6 min to Crows Nest Metro (6 km from CBD).
   - **Artarmon**: ~5-6 min to Crows Nest Metro (7 km from CBD).
   - **Lane Cove**: ~6-7 min to Crows Nest Metro (8 km from CBD).
   - **Lindfield**: ~6-7 min to Chatswood Metro (13 km from CBD).
   - **Roseville**: ~6-7 min to Chatswood Metro (12 km from CBD).
   (Drive times assume light traffic; verify with Google Maps.)
3. **Zoning Check**: Contact councils (North Sydney, Willoughby, Lane Cove, Ku-ring-gai):
   - **R20-R30 Zoning**: Allows triplexes on 900 m²+.
   - Confirm setbacks, height limits (usually 8.5 m), and FSR (0.5:1-0.7:1).
4. **Site Constraints**: Evaluate slope, trees, soil, and access.

---

## Step 3: Assemble a Team
1. **Hire an Architect**: Select one experienced with triplexes near Metro stations.
2. **Engage a Town Planner**: Ensure zoning compliance.
3. **Consult a Builder**: Partner with a multi-dwelling expert (e.g., Clarendon Homes).
4. **Other Experts**: Include a surveyor, structural engineer, and landscaper.

---

## Step 4: Conduct a Feasibility Study
1. **Site Assessment**: Analyze subdivision, access, and environmental factors.
2. **Cost Analysis**: Land ($1.62M-$2.52M, avg $2.04M), construction ($1.5M-$2.1M, avg $1.8M), extras ($300K-$500K, avg $400K). Compare to rental income ($130K-$200K/year, avg $179.4K) or sale value ($3.9M-$4.5M, avg $4.2M).
3. **Timeframe**: Plan for 12-24 months (approvals 3-6 months, construction 9-12 months).

---

## Step 5: Design the Triplex
1. **Layout Options**: Consider side-by-side, double-storey, or hybrid designs.
2. **Family-Friendly Features**: Include 3-4 bedrooms, 2+ bathrooms, 2 parking spaces per home (6 total), and 100 m² yards.
3. **BASIX Compliance**: Incorporate solar panels, water tanks, and insulation.

---

## Step 6: Navigate Approvals
1. **Pre-DA Meeting**: Schedule a discussion with the council.
2. **Submit a DA**: Provide plans, site analysis, and fees ($5K-$10K+); expect 3-6 months for approval.
3. **CDC Option**: Pursue a faster route if compliant.
4. **Subdivision**: Decide on strata or Torrens titles.

---

## Step 7: Secure Financing
1. **Construction Loan**: Obtain $3.42M-$5.12M (avg $4.24M).
2. **Equity**: Leverage owned land if available.
3. **Grants**: Investigate NSW incentives.

---

## Step 8: Prepare for Construction
1. **Finalise Plans**: Complete engineering drawings and obtain a construction certificate.
2. **Tender Builders**: Request quotes for three 200 m² homes.
3. **Utilities**: Arrange Sydney Water connections and road permits.
4. **Site Prep**: Clear, fence, and manage erosion on the 900 m² block.

---

## Step 9: Build and Monitor
1. **Construction**: Allocate 9-12 months for 600 m².
2. **Inspections**: Schedule council checks at footings, framing, and completion.
3. **Subdivision**: Lodge titles if subdividing.

---

## Step 10: Complete and Decide Next Steps
1. **Occupation Certificate**: Secure once compliant.
2. **Fit-Out**: Install kitchens, bathrooms, and landscape yards.
3. **Outcome**: House families, rent units ($1,000-$1,300/week, avg $1,150/week), or sell ($1.3M-$1.5M per unit, avg $1.4M).
