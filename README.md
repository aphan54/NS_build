# Building a Triplex for Three Families on the North Shore, NSW, Sydney: Preparation Plan

You want to build a triplex for three families on Sydney’s North Shore, with each property requiring 300 m² of land (900 m² total) and a 200 m² footprint home (600 m² total built area). The location must be within a 7-minute drive to a station on the new Sydney Metro (e.g., Metro Northwest or City & Southwest lines), excluding suburbs from Crows Nest towards the Sydney CBD and Chatswood. This plan outlines the steps to prepare, factoring in local regulations and your specifications. It assumes you own or will acquire a suitable block. Here’s how to proceed.

---

## Step 1: Define Your Goals and Budget
1. **Clarify Your Purpose**: You’re building for three families, likely for personal use, multi-generational living, or investment. Each 200 m² home suggests spacious, family-oriented design.
2. **Set a Budget**:
   - **Land Cost**: In North Shore suburbs north of Crows Nest (e.g., St Leonards, Artarmon, Lane Cove), 900 m² blocks range from $1,800-$2,800/m², totaling $1.62M-$2.52M.
   - **Construction Cost**: At $2,500-$3,500/m², 600 m² total footprint = $1.5M-$2.1M.
   - **Extras**: Design, approvals, utilities, landscaping, and 10-20% contingency add $300K-$500K.
   - **Total Estimate**: $3.42M-$5.12M.
3. **Research Market Demand**: Suburbs like St Leonards or Lane Cove have strong demand for family homes near Metro stations. Rentals could yield $1,000-$1,300/week per unit; sale values may exceed $1.3M-$1.4M each.

---

## Step 2: Assess Your Land and Zoning
1. **Land Requirement**: You need at least 900 m² (300 m² per family). Verify your block or target properties meeting this size.
2. **Eligible Suburbs**: Focus north of Crows Nest, within 7 minutes’ drive to Metro stations:
   - **St Leonards**: ~5-6 min drive to Crows Nest Metro station (North Sydney Council).
   - **Artarmon**: ~5-6 min drive to Crows Nest Metro station (Willoughby Council).
   - **Lane Cove**: ~6-7 min drive to Crows Nest Metro station (Lane Cove Council).
   (Drive times assume light traffic; verify with Google Maps.)
3. **Zoning Check**: Contact the relevant council:
   - **R20-R30 Zoning**: Typical here, allowing triplexes on 900 m²+.
   - Confirm setbacks, height limits (usually 8.5 m), and floor space ratio (FSR, 0.5:1-0.7:1).
   - Ask about Development Application (DA) or Complying Development Certificate (CDC) eligibility.
4. **Site Constraints**: Assess slope (e.g., Lane Cove’s terrain), trees, soil, and access (e.g., shared driveway).

---

## Step 3: Assemble Your Team
1. **Hire an Architect**: Engage one experienced in triplexes near Metro stations in North Shore suburbs. They’ll design three 200 m² homes on 300 m² lots within 900 m².
2. **Engage a Town Planner**: Key for zoning and council compliance (e.g., Willoughby, North Sydney, or Lane Cove LEP/DCP).
3. **Consult a Builder**: Select a multi-dwelling expert (e.g., Clarendon Homes) for estimates and execution.
4. **Other Experts**: Include a surveyor, structural engineer (for large footprints), and landscaper.

---

## Step 4: Conduct a Feasibility Study
1. **Site Assessment**: Evaluate:
   - Subdivision into three 300 m² lots (strata or Torrens title).
   - Access (shared driveway or separate entries).
   - Environmental factors (e.g., bushfire risk in Lane Cove).
2. **Cost Analysis**: Combine land ($1.62M-$2.52M), construction ($1.5M-$2.1M), and extras ($300K-$500K). Compare to rental income ($130K-$200K/year) or sale value ($3.9M-$4.2M total).
3. **Timeframe**: Expect 12-24 months, including approvals (3-6 months) and construction (9-12 months).

---

## Step 5: Design the Triplex
1. **Layout Options**:
   - **Side-by-Side**: Three 200 m² single-storey homes (needs ~45 m frontage).
   - **Double-Storey**: Three 200 m² homes over two levels (100 m² per floor), ideal for narrower blocks.
   - **Hybrid**: Mix of single and double-storey units.
2. **Family-Friendly Features**: Plan 3-4 bedrooms, 2+ bathrooms, open-plan living, and 2 parking spaces per home (6 total). Use remaining 100 m² per lot for yards or balconies.
3. **BASIX Compliance**: NSW requires a Building Sustainability Index (BASIX) certificate. Add solar panels, water tanks, and insulation.

---

## Step 6: Navigate Approvals
1. **Pre-DA Meeting**: Meet your council (e.g., Lane Cove Council) to discuss the triplex.
2. **Submit a Development Application (DA)**:
   - Include plans, site analysis, shadow diagrams, and a Statement of Environmental Effects (SEE).
   - Fees: $5,000-$10,000+.
   - Approval: 3-6 months, longer if objections arise.
3. **CDC Option**: If compliant, a private certifier can approve faster. Confirm with council.
4. **Subdivision**: Choose strata titles (three units, one lot) or Torrens titles (three 300 m² lots, costlier but valuable).

---

## Step 7: Secure Financing
1. **Construction Loan**: Secure $3.42M-$5.12M, backed by plans and costings.
2. **Equity**: Use owned land to reduce borrowing.
3. **Grants**: Check NSW sustainability incentives.

---

## Step 8: Prepare for Construction
1. **Finalise Plans**: Get engineering drawings and a construction certificate (CC).
2. **Tender Builders**: Obtain quotes for three 200 m² homes; sign an HIA/MBA contract.
3. **Utilities**: Connect water, power, and sewer via Sydney Water. Secure road permits if needed.
4. **Site Prep**: Clear the 900 m² block, fence it, and manage erosion.

---

## Step 9: Build and Monitor
1. **Construction**: 9-12 months for 600 m² total footprint. Monitor progress.
2. **Inspections**: Council checks at footings, framing, and completion.
3. **Subdivision**: Lodge titles with NSW Land Registry if subdividing.

---

## Step 10: Completion and Next Steps
1. **Occupation Certificate (OC)**: Issued when homes meet standards.
2. **Fit-Out**: Install kitchens, bathrooms, and landscape 100 m² yards per lot.
3. **Outcome**: House three families, rent ($1,000-$1,300/week per unit), or sell ($1.3M-$1.4M per unit).

## How Estimates Were Calculated
- **Land Cost ($1.62M-$2.52M)**:
  - **Basis**: Median land prices in St Leonards, Artarmon, and Lane Cove from recent sales data (e.g., Domain, Realestate.com.au, March 2025 trends).
  - **Range**: $1,800/m² (lower-end Lane Cove) to $2,800/m² (premium St Leonards near Metro). Multiplied by 900 m².
- **Construction Cost ($1.5M-$2.1M)**:
  - **Basis**: Industry standards for medium-high quality homes in Sydney (e.g., Rawlinsons Construction Cost Guide 2025).
  - **Range**: $2,500/m² (basic finishes) to $3,500/m² (higher-end with sustainability features). Multiplied by 600 m² total footprint.
- **Extras ($300K-$500K)**:
  - **Breakdown**: 
    - Design/architect fees (~$50K-$100K).
    - DA/CDC fees ($5K-$10K+).
    - Utilities connections ($50K-$80K, Sydney Water rates).
    - Landscaping ($50K-$100K for 300 m² yards).
    - Contingency (10-20% of construction, $150K-$210K).
  - **Basis**: Typical project add-ons in NSW multi-dwelling developments.
- **Rental Income ($130K-$200K/year)**:
  - **Basis**: Market rents for 3-4 bed homes near Metro stations (e.g., St Leonards $1,000-$1,300/week). Multiplied by 3 units, 52 weeks.
- **Sale Value ($3.9M-$4.2M)**:
  - **Basis**: Recent triplex unit sales in Artarmon/Lane Cove ($1.3M-$1.4M per 200 m² home), adjusted for Metro proximity.

Estimates reflect March 2025 conditions, proximity to Metro stations, and North Shore market trends. Prices may vary with location, finishes, and economic shifts—verify with local agents and builders.
