# Building a Triplex for Three Families on the North Shore, NSW, Sydney: Preparation Plan

This plan outlines the steps to prepare for building a triplex for three families on Sydney’s North Shore, where each property requires 300 m² of land (900 m² total) and a 200 m² footprint home (600 m² total built area). The location must be within a 7-minute drive to a station on the new Sydney Metro (e.g., Crows Nest or Chatswood stations on the City & Southwest line), excluding suburbs from Crows Nest towards the Sydney CBD and Chatswood itself. The plan includes St Leonards (North Sydney Council), Artarmon (Willoughby Council), Lane Cove (Lane Cove Council), and Lindfield, Roseville, and Roseville Chase (Ku-ring-gai Council), all 6-13 km from CBD, meeting the Metro proximity requirement. It assumes ownership or acquisition of a suitable block. Here’s how to proceed.

---

## Step 1: Define Goals and Budget
1. **Clarify Purpose**: Determine if the triplex is for personal use, multi-generational living, or investment. Each 200 m² home suggests a spacious, family-oriented design.
2. **Set a Budget**:
   - **Land Cost**: Range $1.62M-$2.52M, Average $2.04M for 900 m².
   - **Construction Cost**: Range $1.5M-$2.1M, Average $1.8M for 600 m² total footprint.
   - **Extras**: Range $300K-$500K, Average $400K (design, approvals, utilities, landscaping, contingency).
   - **Total Estimate**: Range $3.42M-$5.12M, Average $4.24M.
3. **Research Market Demand**: These suburbs have strong demand near Metro stations. Rentals could yield $1,000-$1,300/week per unit (average $1,150/week); sale values may exceed $1.3M-$1.5M per unit (average $1.4M).

---

## Step 2: Assess Land and Zoning
1. **Land Requirement**: Secure at least 900 m² (300 m² per family).
2. **Eligible Suburbs**: Choose locations within 7 minutes’ drive to Metro stations, 6-13 km from CBD:
   - **St Leonards**: ~5-6 min to Crows Nest Metro (6 km from CBD, North Sydney Council).
   - **Artarmon**: ~5-6 min to Crows Nest Metro (7 km from CBD, Willoughby Council).
   - **Lane Cove**: ~6-7 min to Crows Nest Metro (8 km from CBD, Lane Cove Council).
   - **Lindfield**: ~6-7 min to Chatswood Metro (13 km from CBD, Ku-ring-gai Council).
   - **Roseville**: ~6-7 min to Chatswood Metro (12 km from CBD, Ku-ring-gai Council).
   - **Roseville Chase**: ~6-7 min to Chatswood Metro (12 km from CBD, Ku-ring-gai Council).
   (Drive times assume light traffic; verify with Google Maps.)
3. **Zoning Check**: Confirm zoning with each council’s Local Environmental Plan (LEP). Below are detailed zoning requirements for triplex development:

### North Sydney Council (St Leonards)
- **Relevant LEP**: North Sydney Local Environmental Plan 2013 (amended to 2025).
- **Applicable Zones**: R3 Medium Density Residential (common in St Leonards near Metro).
- **Minimum Lot Size**: 600 m² for multi-dwelling housing (Clause 4.1); 900 m² exceeds this.
- **Height Limit**: 12 m (Clause 4.3, varies by map; check Height of Buildings Map).
- **Floor Space Ratio (FSR)**: 0.9:1 (Clause 4.4, check FSR Map). For 900 m²: 810 m² max GFA; 600 m² fits.
- **Triplex Permissibility**: “Multi-dwelling housing” permitted in R3 zones. Strata or Torrens subdivision possible (Clause 4.1A).
- **Specific Considerations**: High-density overlays near Metro; ensure setbacks (6 m front, 3 m side/rear) and parking (6 spaces) per North Sydney DCP 2013. Check heritage/flood zones.

### Willoughby Council (Artarmon)
- **Relevant LEP**: Willoughby Local Environmental Plan 2012 (amended to 2025).
- **Applicable Zones**: R2 Low Density Residential or R3 Medium Density Residential.
- **Minimum Lot Size**: R2: 450 m² (NSW dual occupancy reform, 2025); R3: 700 m² for multi-dwelling housing (Clause 4.1). 900 m² exceeds both.
- **Height Limit**: R2: 9.5 m; R3: 12 m (Clause 4.3, check Height of Buildings Map).
- **Floor Space Ratio (FSR)**: R2: 0.5:1 (450 m² GFA); R3: 0.7:1 (630 m² GFA) (Clause 4.4, check FSR Map). 600 m² fits R3, exceeds R2.
- **Triplex Permissibility**: R2 allows dual occupancy; R3 permits “multi-dwelling housing.” Target R3 zones; Strata/Torrens viable.
- **Specific Considerations**: Willoughby DCP 2022 requires 6 m front setback, 1.5-3 m side/rear, 50% landscaping, 6 parking spaces. Check bushfire/heritage.

### Lane Cove Council (Lane Cove)
- **Relevant LEP**: Lane Cove Local Environmental Plan 2009 (amended to 2025).
- **Applicable Zones**: R3 Medium Density Residential.
- **Minimum Lot Size**: 800 m² for multi-dwelling housing (Clause 4.1); 900 m² meets this.
- **Height Limit**: 9.5 m (Clause 4.3, up to 12 m near hubs; check Height of Buildings Map).
- **Floor Space Ratio (FSR)**: 0.6:1 (Clause 4.4, check FSR Map). For 900 m²: 540 m² max GFA; 600 m² exceeds, needs variation.
- **Triplex Permissibility**: “Multi-dwelling housing” permitted in R3; Strata/Torrens allowed (Clause 4.1A). R2 limits to dual occupancy.
- **Specific Considerations**: Lane Cove DCP 2010 mandates 6 m front setback, 3 m side/rear, 40% landscaping, 6 parking spaces. Check slopes/heritage.

### Ku-ring-gai Council (Lindfield, Roseville, Roseville Chase)
- **Relevant LEP**: Ku-ring-gai Local Environmental Plan 2015 (amended to 2025).
- **Applicable Zones**: R2 Low Density Residential or R3 Medium Density Residential.
- **Minimum Lot Size**: R2: 700 m² proposed for dual occupancy (2025 consultation, Option A); R3: 900 m² for multi-dwelling housing (Clause 4.1). 900 m² meets R3, exceeds R2.
- **Height Limit**: R2: 9.5 m; R3: 12 m (Clause 4.3, check Height of Buildings Map; varies near stations).
- **Floor Space Ratio (FSR)**: R2: 0.3:1 (270 m² GFA); R3: 0.6:1 (540 m² GFA) (Clause 4.4, check FSR Map). 600 m² exceeds both; R3 variation feasible.
- **Triplex Permissibility**: R2 permits dual occupancy; R3 allows “multi-dwelling housing.” Focus on R3 zones; Strata/Torrens possible.
- **Specific Considerations**: Ku-ring-gai DCP 2016 requires 50% canopy cover, 8 m front setback, 3 m side/rear, 6 parking spaces. Check heritage (e.g., Roseville HCA).

4. **Site Constraints**: Investigate these factors for each potential site:
   - **Topography and Slope**: Assess gradient for foundation, excavation, drainage. Slopes >15% need retaining walls/stepped designs.
   - **Soil Type and Stability**: Test clay, rock, or sandy soils. Clay may require deeper footings; rock increases costs.
   - **Tree Preservation**: Identify protected trees (e.g., Ku-ring-gai’s 50% canopy). Removal needs approval/offsets.
   - **Flood Risk**: Check flood maps (e.g., St Leonards stormwater, Lane Cove lowlands). Flood-prone sites need mitigation.
   - **Bushfire Risk**: Evaluate BAL ratings (e.g., Ku-ring-gai’s leafy areas). BAL-29+ requires fire-resistant materials.
   - **Heritage Constraints**: Confirm listings/conservation areas (e.g., Roseville HCA). Limits demolition/design.
   - **Access and Driveways**: Ensure 15 m width for shared driveway, street access for 6 parking spaces.
   - **Utility Connections**: Verify sewer, water, power proximity (Sydney Water, Ausgrid). Easements may restrict layout.
   - **Shadow Impacts**: Model solar access for neighbors (2-3 hours midwinter per DCP). Taller designs may trigger objections.
   - **Noise and Traffic**: Assess proximity to highways (e.g., Pacific Hwy) or rail lines. Acoustic buffering may be needed.
   - **Contamination**: Check past industrial use (e.g., Artarmon). Soil testing for pollutants required.
   - **Overland Flow Paths**: Map stormwater runoff (e.g., Lane Cove, Ku-ring-gai). Avoid floodways; design drainage.
   - **Privacy Impacts**: Ensure setbacks/windows minimize overlooking (3 m side/rear per DCPs).
   - **Easements and Covenants**: Check title for restrictions (e.g., drainage easements). Limits buildable area.
   - **Site Orientation**: Optimize north-facing for solar gain (BASIX). Poor orientation increases energy costs.
   - **Geotechnical Hazards**: Investigate landslides/subsidence (e.g., Ku-ring-gai slopes). Geotech reports may be mandatory.
   - **Vegetation and Biodiversity**: Identify native species/habitat (e.g., Ku-ring-gai koala corridors). Clearing needs assessment.

## Step 3: Evaluate a Possible Property
Evaluate the property at **32 Ormonde Road, Roseville Chase, NSW 2069**, a 4,500 m² parcel being subdivided into four lots, with one lot of 1,100 m² targeted for purchase. Assess against Steps 1 and 2 criteria:

### Step 1 Criteria Evaluation
1. **Purpose**: The 1,100 m² lot exceeds the 900 m² minimum, supporting a triplex for personal use, multi-generational living, or investment. Each 200 m² home fits family-oriented design.
2. **Budget**:
   - **Land Cost**: 32 Ormonde Road sold for $6.4M (Dec 2023, Domain). For four lots (4,500 m²), assume equal split: $6.4M ÷ 4 = $1.6M per lot (1,125 m² avg). Adjusted for 1,100 m² and +5% to March 2025: $1.6M × (1,100/1,125) × 1.05 ≈ $1.64M. This fits the $1.62M-$2.52M range (avg $2.04M), slightly below average.
   - **Construction Cost**: $1.5M-$2.1M (avg $1.8M) for 600 m² remains applicable.
   - **Extras**: $300K-$500K (avg $400K) unchanged.
   - **Total Estimate**: $1.64M (land) + $1.8M (construction) + $400K (extras) = $3.84M. Fits $3.42M-$5.12M range (avg $4.24M), cost-effective.
3. **Market Demand**: Roseville Chase aligns with Roseville data (6-7 min to Chatswood Metro). Rentals at $1,000-$1,200/week (avg $1,125/week) yield $175.5K/year for three units (within $130K-$200K, avg $179.4K). Sale value at $1.35M-$1.5M/unit (avg $1.425M) totals $4.275M (within $3.9M-$4.5M, avg $4.2M).

### Step 2 Criteria Evaluation
1. **Land Requirement**: 1,100 m² exceeds 900 m², providing flexibility (e.g., larger yards or parking).
2. **Location**: Roseville Chase is ~6-7 min drive to Chatswood Metro (12 km from CBD), verified via Google Maps (light traffic), meeting the 7-minute criterion.
3. **Zoning (Ku-ring-gai Council)**:
   - **Zone**: Likely R3 Medium Density Residential (near Chatswood Metro, supports multi-dwelling housing). Confirm via Ku-ring-gai LEP 2015 zoning map.
   - **Minimum Lot Size**: 900 m² for R3; 1,100 m² complies.
   - **Height Limit**: 12 m in R3 (double-storey triplex feasible, ~10 m height).
   - **FSR**: 0.6:1 in R3; 1,100 m² × 0.6 = 660 m² max GFA. 600 m² fits within this, no variation needed (unlike 900 m² at 540 m² GFA).
   - **Permissibility**: “Multi-dwelling housing” permitted in R3; Strata/Torrens viable.
   - **Considerations**: Ku-ring-gai DCP 2016 requires 8 m front setback, 3 m side/rear, 50% canopy cover, 6 parking spaces—all achievable on 1,100 m².
4. **Site Constraints**:
   - **Topography/Slope**: Waterfront reserve backdrop (McGrath listing) suggests slope to Middle Harbour. Assess gradient; >15% may need retaining walls.
   - **Soil Type/Stability**: North Shore clay/sandstone common. Test for footings; waterfront proximity may indicate softer soils.
   - **Tree Preservation**: 50% canopy cover required. Waterfront bushland likely has protected trees; arborist report needed.
   - **Flood Risk**: Near Middle Harbour; check Ku-ring-gai flood maps for low-lying areas.
   - **Bushfire Risk**: Leafy area near bushwalks (Davidson Park); BAL-29+ possible, requiring fire-resistant design.
   - **Heritage Constraints**: No HCA at 32 Ormonde Road (unlike Roseville); confirm via council register.
   - **Access/Driveways**: Circular driveway exists (McGrath). 1,100 m² lot needs 15 m frontage for 6 parking spaces—verify post-subdivision.
   - **Utility Connections**: Existing house suggests sewer/water/power nearby; confirm Sydney Water/Ausgrid capacity for triplex.
   - **Shadow Impacts**: 12 m height on 1,100 m² allows modeling; ensure 2-3 hours sunlight for neighbors.
   - **Noise/Traffic**: Quiet street, but proximity to Warringah Road (Roseville Chase bisector) may require acoustic buffering.
   - **Contamination**: Residential history; low risk, but test soil near waterfront.
   - **Overland Flow Paths**: Waterfront runoff likely; design drainage to avoid floodways.
   - **Privacy Impacts**: 3 m setbacks feasible on 1,100 m²; orient windows away from neighbors.
   - **Easements/Covenants**: Check title post-subdivision; waterfront may have drainage easements.
   - **Site Orientation**: North-facing potential (waterfront north of property); optimize solar gain.
   - **Geotechnical Hazards**: Slopes to water may pose landslide risk; geotech report needed.
   - **Vegetation/Biodiversity**: Bushland proximity (koala corridors possible); ecological assessment required.

### Conclusion
32 Ormonde Road’s 1,100 m² lot is viable for a triplex. It meets land size, location, and zoning (R3) requirements, fits budget (below avg $4.24M), and aligns with market demand. Site constraints (slope, trees, flood/bushfire risk) need investigation, but 200 m² extra land offers design flexibility. Confirm zoning, subdivision status, and constraints with Ku-ring-gai Council.
