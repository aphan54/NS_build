# Estimating Residential Land Cost per Square Meter in Roseville Chase, NSW, Australia (1100 sqm Land)

## Introduction
This report estimates the cost per square meter for residential land in Roseville Chase, NSW, Australia, for a 1100 sqm parcel. Tailored for investors, it analyzes land values in this North Shore suburb, known for spacious blocks and proximity to amenities. Properties with existing houses are sampled, deducting insurance-based house replacement costs from sale prices to isolate land value. The report includes at least five properties per bedroom type (3, 4, and 5 bedrooms), providing high, low, and average estimates with detailed breakdowns.

## Methodology
1. **Data Sources**: Sales data from real estate platforms (e.g., Domain, Realestate.com.au) and web searches for 2023-2025 Roseville Chase transactions. Approximations adjust historical trends to March 07, 2025 market conditions.
2. **Property Selection**: Houses only (no apartments), land sizes ~1100 sqm (±20%), covering 3, 4, and 5-bedroom configurations.
3. **House Value Deduction**: Replacement cost estimated via insurance principles (construction cost/sqm, adjusted for size, age, quality), using 2025 Sydney benchmarks (e.g., Cordell Construction Cost Guide).
4. **Land Value Calculation**: Sale price minus house cost = land value, divided by land size for cost/sqm.
5. **Estimates**: High, low, and average costs/sqm calculated across samples, with transparent breakdowns.

## Assumptions
- Construction costs: AUD 2,500–3,500/sqm (mid-range to high-end, typical for Roseville Chase).
- Sydney North Shore land prices reflect a premium over Statista’s 2023 AUD 1,505/sqm greenfield average.
- Market stabilized post-2024 rate peaks, per 2025 forecasts.
