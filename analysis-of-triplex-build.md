# Plan for Designing a Triplex with Two Co-Investors

## Overview
This plan outlines the process of designing a triplex (three attached residential units) with two co-investors, who may either keep or sell their units. The goal is to create a functional, marketable, and cost-effective design, balancing individual preferences with investment returns. The process involves collaboration with an architect for design, builders for construction, and a detailed cost analysis per feature to inform decisions. The triplex is assumed to be built on a single lot (e.g., 1100 sqm), with considerations for resale value or long-term ownership.

## Step 1: Decisions with the Architect
When designing a triplex, you’ll work with an architect to define the layout, style, and functionality. Here’s what you need to decide, akin to designing a standalone house but scaled for three units:

### 1.1 Unit Configuration
- **Number of Bedrooms per Unit**: Options: 2, 3, or 4 bedrooms per unit.
  - Rationale: Impacts marketability (e.g., families vs. couples) and cost. Decide if all units are identical or vary (e.g., one 4-bed, two 3-bed).
- **Unit Size**: Total floor area per unit (e.g., 120 sqm, 150 sqm, 180 sqm).
  - Rationale: Larger units increase costs but may appeal to premium buyers or suit investor retention.
- **Floors**: Single-storey vs. two-storey design.
  - Rationale: Single-storey saves on structural costs; two-storey maximizes land use but adds complexity.

### 1.2 Layout and Shared Spaces
- **Internal Layout**: Open-plan vs. traditional (separate rooms for kitchen, living, dining).
  - Rationale: Open-plan is modern and cost-efficient; traditional suits specific demographics.
- **Shared vs. Private Areas**: Common areas (e.g., garden, driveway) vs. fully separated units (e.g., private entrances, yards).
  - Rationale: Shared spaces reduce costs but may deter buyers wanting privacy.
- **Parking**: Garages (single/double) or carports per unit.
  - Rationale: Garages add value but increase costs; carports are cheaper.

### 1.3 Design Features
- **Kitchen Size**: Small (e.g., 10 sqm), medium (15 sqm), or large (20 sqm).
  - Rationale: Larger kitchens appeal to families but raise fit-out costs.
- **Bathrooms**: Number per unit (e.g., 1, 1.5, or 2).
  - Rationale: More bathrooms increase comfort and value but add plumbing costs.
- **Flooring**: Tile vs. timber vs. hybrid options.
  - Rationale: Affects cost, durability, and aesthetic appeal.
- **Outdoor Space**: Balconies, patios, or small yards per unit.
  - Rationale: Enhances livability but reduces buildable area.

### 1.4 Compliance and Style
- **Local Regulations**: Zoning, setbacks, height restrictions (e.g., Ku-ring-gai Council for Roseville Chase).
  - Rationale: Ensures approval; architect confirms compliance.
- **Architectural Style**: Modern, traditional, or hybrid.
  - Rationale: Aligns with market trends and investor preferences (e.g., modern for resale, traditional for retention).

### 1.5 Investor Input
- **Retention vs. Sale**: Will any investor live in a unit? If so, customize their unit (e.g., extra room, premium finishes).
- **Budget Split**: Agree on total budget and cost allocation (equal thirds or proportional to unit size/ownership).
- **Timeline**: Design phase duration (e.g., 2-3 months).

## Step 2: Discussions with Builders
Once the architect drafts plans, engage builders for construction feasibility and cost estimates. Key discussion points:

### 2.1 Construction Feasibility
- **Site Assessment**: Soil type, slope, access (e.g., 1100 sqm flat vs. sloping land).
  - Impact: Affects foundation costs (e.g., slab vs. piers).
- **Unit Separation**: Structural walls (fire-rated, soundproofed) between units.
  - Impact: Ensures compliance and privacy, adding to costs.

### 2.2 Cost Estimates
- **Base Build Costs**: Per sqm rate for structure (e.g., AUD 2,500–3,500/sqm in Sydney, 2025).
- **Feature-Specific Costs**: Quotes for kitchens, bathrooms, flooring, etc. (see breakdown below).
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Driveway, utilities (water, electricity, sewer) split across units.

### 2.3 Timeline and Logistics
- **Build Duration**: Single-storey (6-9 months) vs. two-storey (9-12 months).
- **Staging**: Build all units simultaneously or in phases (if investors retain units later).
- **Permits**: Builder confirms council approval timeline (e.g., DA process in NSW).

### 2.4 Quality and Materials
- **Finish Level**: Basic, mid-range, or premium (e.g., cabinetry, fixtures).
- **Material Choices**: Concrete vs. brick walls, tile vs. metal roofing.
  - Impact: Balances cost vs. durability/market appeal.

## Step 3: Cost Breakdown per Feature
Below is an estimated cost breakdown per feature, based on 2025 Sydney construction rates (e.g., Cordell Cost Guide, adjusted). Costs are per unit unless stated, assuming a triplex on 1100 sqm. Investors can adjust based on quotes.

### 3.1 Base Structure
- **Single-Storey**: AUD 2,500/sqm
  - 120 sqm unit = 120 × 2,500 = AUD 300,000
  - 150 sqm unit = 150 × 2,500 = AUD 375,000
- **Two-Storey**: AUD 3,000/sqm (extra for stairs, foundations)
  - 120 sqm unit = 120 × 3,000 = AUD 360,000
  - 150 sqm unit = 150 × 3,000 = AUD 450,000
- **Total Triplex (3 × 150 sqm)**:
  - Single-storey: AUD 1,125,000
  - Two-storey: AUD 1,350,000

  - 150 sqm unit = 150 × 100 = AUD 15,000
- **Timber**: AUD 150/sqm installed
  - 120 sqm unit = 120 × 150 = AUD 18,000
  - 150 sqm unit = 150 × 150 = AUD 22,500
- **Total for 3 Units (150 sqm each)**:

## Action Plan
1. **Investor Meeting**: Agree on budget (e.g., AUD 1.5–2M), unit sizes, and retention plans.
2. **Hire Architect**: Draft initial plans (2-3 months, AUD 20,000–40,000 fee).
3. **Review Designs**: Finalize layout, features based on cost breakdown.
4. **Builder Quotes**: Select builder, refine costs (1-2 months).
5. **Council Approval**: Submit DA (3-6 months in NSW).
6. **Construction**: 9-12 months, monitor budget splits.

## Considerations for Investors
- **Flexibility**: If one keeps a unit, customize it (e.g., larger kitchen) but adjust cost shares.
- **Marketability**: Mid-range finishes (timber, 2 baths) balance cost vs. resale value.
- **Risk**: Delays or cost overruns—build contingency (10–15%) into budget.

This plan provides a structured approach to designing and costing a triplex, ensuring transparency and collaboration among investors.
