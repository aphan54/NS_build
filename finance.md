# Triplex Investment Loan Repayments in Australia (AUD 4.35M Project)

## Overview
Three investors are funding a triplex development on empty land in Australia, with a total project cost of AUD 4.35 million. Each investor contributes equally (1/3), and this report investigates loan repayments for the investment, assuming a joint loan split evenly unless customized. It includes monthly repayment breakdowns, deposit variations in AUD 50,000 increments per investor, and custom loan increases in AUD 50,000 steps up to AUD 300,000 per investor. Data is based on typical Australian investment loan conditions as of March 10, 2025.

## Assumptions
| Assumption            | Details                                                                    |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Total Project Cost    | AUD 4,35M (construction, land, fees)                                       |
| Base Deposit          | 20% of AUD 4.35M = AUD 870,000 (AUD 290,000 per investor)                  |
| Loan Amount           | AUD 4.35M - AUD 870,000 = AUD 3.48M (AUD 1.16M per investor)               |
| Interest Rate         | 6.5% p.a. (variable, typical for investment loans in 2025, per ABS trends) |
| Loan Term             | 30 years (standard mortgage term)                                          |
| Repayment Type        | Principal & Interest (P&I)                                                 |
| Currency              | AUD                                                                        |

- **Notes**: Interest rate reflects 2025 forecasts (post-2024 stabilization, ~6-7% for investment loans). Adjust deposit/loan splits if land cost is separate (not specified here).

## 1. Base Loan Repayments (No Custom Changes)
| Investor Share        | Total Project (AUD) | Deposit (AUD) | Loan Amount (AUD) | Monthly Repayment (AUD) |
|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Each Investor (1/3)   | 1,450,000           | 290,000       | 1,160,000         | 7,326                   |
| Total Triplex         | 4,350,000           | 870,000       | 3,480,000         | 21,978                  |

- **Calculation**: Monthly repayment for AUD 1.16M at 6.5% over 30 years = AUD 7,326 (using standard mortgage formula: `P = [r*PV] / [1 - (1 + r)^-n]`, where `r` = 0.065/12, `PV` = 1,160,000, `n` = 360).

## 2. Deposit Increase Variations (AUD 50,000 Increments per Investor)
Each investor increases their deposit by AUD 50,000 increments, reducing their loan share. Total deposit increases by AUD 150,000 per step (3 investors).

| Deposit per Investor (AUD) | Total Deposit (AUD) | Loan per Investor (AUD) | Total Loan (AUD) | Monthly Repayment per Investor (AUD) | Total Monthly Repayment (AUD) |
|----------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 290,000 (Base)             | 870,000             | 1,160,000               | 3,480,000        | 7,326                        | 21,978                        |

| 390,000 (+100k)            | 1,170,000           | 1,060,000               | 3,180,000        | 6,694                        | 20,082                        |
| 440,000 (+150k)            | 1,320,000           | 1,010,000               | 3,030,000        | 6,378                        | 19,134                        |
| 490,000 (+200k)            | 1,470,000           | 960,000                 | 2,880,000        | 6,062                        | 18,186                        |
| 540,000 (+250k)            | 1,620,000           | 910,000                 | 2,730,000        | 5,746                        | 17,238                        |

- **Notes**: Each AUD 50,000 deposit increase reduces the loan by AUD 50,000 per investor, lowering monthly repayments by ~AUD 316 (calculated via mortgage formula).

## 3. Custom Loan Increases (AUD 50,000 Increments, up to AUD 300,000)
One investor customizes their unit (e.g., upgrades), increasing their loan share in AUD 50,000 steps, capped at AUD 300,000. Others remain at base loan (AUD 1.16M). Total loan adjusts accordingly.

| Custom Increase (AUD) | Investor 1 Loan (AUD) | Investor 2 Loan (AUD) | Investor 3 Loan (AUD) | Total Loan (AUD) | Investor 1 Monthly Repayment (AUD) | Investor 2&3 Monthly Repayment (AUD) | Total Monthly Repayment (AUD) |

- **Calculation**: Each AUD 50,000 loan increase adds ~AUD 316 to Investor 1’s monthly repayment (same mortgage formula). Total loan and repayments reflect the sum.

## Analysis
| Aspect                | Details                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Base Case             | AUD 7,326/month per investor is manageable with rental income potential (e.g., AUD 800-1,000/week/unit in Roseville Chase). |
| Deposit Increases     | Each AUD 50k deposit saves AUD 316/month per investor; max savings at AUD 540k deposit = AUD 1,580/month each. |
| Custom Changes        | Investor 1’s max increase (AUD 300k) raises their repayment to AUD 9,222 (+AUD 1,896/month), others unchanged. |
| Flexibility           | Adjust deposit or loan splits if land cost is separate or investors retain units (e.g., rental offset). |

## Conclusion
For a AUD 4.35M triplex, base loan repayments are AUD 7,326/month per investor (AUD 1.16M loan each). Increasing deposits by AUD 50k reduces this by AUD 316/month per step, while custom upgrades increase Investor 1’s repayment up to AUD 9,222/month at AUD 300k extra. Investors should weigh rental yields (e.g., 4-5% in NSW) against costs and consult lenders (e.g., ANZ, Trilogy Funds) for exact rates/terms."
